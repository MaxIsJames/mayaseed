Appleseed currently supports a set of powerful predefined materials, brdfs, edfs and surface_shaders. mayaseed takes a set of entity definitions name `appleseedEntityDefs.xml` generated by appleseed.cli and uses them to create shading node templates in maya that mirror their appleseed counterparts.

All mayaseed matarials must have an ms_material at their root, create an ms_material by chosing `Mayaseed > Create Material`. 

As maya has no notion of explicit front and back materials the ms_material has slots for front and back bsdfs, edfs and surface_shaders.

Once you have your ms_material you then need to connect up some other shading nodes. To create shading nodes chose `Mayaseed > Create Bsdf` etc. 

Its worth noting that in appleseed an attribute of a material or shading node takes other shading node entities as arguments rather than attributes of other shading nodes, so you might connect `bsdf_1 -> material_1.bsdf`. This is to maya where you might connect `shading_node_1.outColor -> material_1.color`. Because of this the attributes you use to connect up materials and shading nodes in maya can be arbitary, for example, connecting `my_shading_node.outColor -> my_ms_material.front_bsdf_color` will have the same effect as `my_shading_node.message -> my_ms_material.front_bsdf_color`. 

Below is a typical shading network using an ms_material.

>Note: Maya has a limitation with render nodes that have attributes generated at runtime. This means that when you graph a nodes connections you may not see the whole heirachy. As a work arround graph connections of a node, then select all the connections that are shown and graph connections again, keep doing this until you can see all the nodes in the heirachy.

Known issues
------------

When you first create a shading node you might find that it has no attributes shown. The attributes are there you just need to expand the `Extra Attributes` secion to see them.
