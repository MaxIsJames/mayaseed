		say you want to render a refractive sphere of glass, say IOR = 1.4
		on the front side of the sphere, you'll need to assign a material with a specular_btdf with "from_ior" set to 1.0 (the "outside" ior) and "to_ior" set to 1.4 (the sphere ior)
		on the back side of the sphere, you'll need to do the opposite: assign a material with a specular_btdf with "from_ior" set to 1.4 and "to_ior" set to 1.0 (again, the outside)
