What is mayaseed?
-----------------

mayaseed is a plugin for Maya that exports geometry, lights and materials from Maya to the fantastic [appleseed](http://appleseedhq.net/) renderer. Appleseed is an open source physically based renderer built br Fran√ßois Beaune, find out more about appleseed here. Rather than being a built-in maya renderer mayaseed currently parses the Maya scene and outputs an appleseed scene file plus all the necisarry textures and geometry for rendering in appleseed.studio or appleseed.cli.
