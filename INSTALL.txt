NOTE: for some features to work you may need to build the latest version of appleseed, for instructions on how to do this please visit the following address:

NOTE: for the latest version of this plugin visit the Mayaseed github page:

https://github.com/jonathantopf/mayaseed



INSTALLATION --------

To start unzip the plugin contents to a directory of your choice, but make sure to remember it for later. Any time you see <mayaseed_root> in this document replace it with your install directory. For example if put the exporter files in the following directory:

/projects/mayaseed

i would replace the following line:

putenv MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH ($env_script_path + ":<mayaseed root>/plugins");

with this:

putenv MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH ($env_plugin_path + ":/projects/mayaseed/plugins");


Next you will first need to copy a few lines of text to your userSetup.mel file, usually located in your Maya scripts directory, if its not there just create it as a plain text file with the .mel extension.

Heres the default scripts directory for the main platforms:

Mac: /Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/maya/<maya version>/scripts
Windows Vista and higher: C:\Users\<username>\Documents\maya\<maya version>\scripts (you may have My Documents instead of Documents)
Windows XP and lower: C:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents\maya\<maya version>\scripts
Linux: /usr/aw/userconfig/maya/<maya version>/scripts

So copy the following lines to your useSetup.mel file

// mayaseed setup -----------------------------------------------

// maya to appleseed setup -----------------------------------------------

$env_script_path = `getenv MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH`;
$env_plugin_path = `getenv MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH`;

putenv MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH ($env_script_path + "<mayaseed_root>/graphics");

putenv MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH ($env_plugin_path + "<mayaseed root>/plugins");

// maya to appleseed setup -----------------------------------------------



Next you will want to start up Maya and enable the plugin, to do this choose window > settings preferences > plugin manager and load 'mayaseed.py', you will also want to click autoload so you don't have to do this step every time Maya loads.


That should be everything, if everythign has gone to plan you shuld have a new menu called mayaseed where you can create new ms_renderSettings nodes. This exporter is very much a work in progress and many improvements/features are planned for the future. Also please submit any bugs/feature requests as this is meant to be practical and usable software and I'd love to hear how it is being used.
