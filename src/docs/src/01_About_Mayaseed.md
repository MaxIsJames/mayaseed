Mayaseed docs - About Mayaseed
=============



What is Mayaseed?
-----------------

Mayaseed is a plugin for Maya that exports geometry, lights and materials to the appleseed renderer. Mayaseed has been tested on Maya 2010 or newer, it should also run on older versions but has not been tested.

What is appleseed?
------------------

appleseed is an open source physically-based raytracing renderer that does a whole bunch of cool things that a lot of other open source renderers don't. Take a look here:

Mayaseed Licence
----------------

Like appleseed, Mayaseed is released under the MIT licence which means it is free to use and modify to your hearts content.

How it's made
-------------

Mayaseed is written mainly in Python with a little bit of MEL so it is cross platform and easy to modify. You can find more about the structure of the plugin in the **Plugin structure** section. New releases will be announced on the appleseed website here:

You can also download the latest development snapshot from the appleseed GitHub page here:

So far Mayaseed is mainly written by one person ([Jonathan Topf](http://www.jonathantopf.com/)) and that person is not a professional developer by any stretch of the imagination, so you may encounter a bug from time to time. If you do find a bug file an issue and I will try to fix it, here is the link for bug reports:

Equally if you have a feature request file an issue and tag it as a feature request and I'll see what I can do.
