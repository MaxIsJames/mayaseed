Mayaseed docs - Python Module reference
=======================================


With mayaseed correctly installed you also have the following new python modules available to you.

+ ms_commands 
+ ms_export

ms_commands module
------------------

**ms_commands** is where all the common functions, classes and variables reside, this section describes them. 


###Variable: ms\_commands.MAYASEED_VERSION####

This variable will return the current Mayaseed version.


###Variable: ms\_commands.MAYASEED_URL###

This variable will return the URL of the Mayaseed website.


###Variable: ms\_commands.APPLESEED_URL###

This variable will return the URL of the appleseed website.


###Variable: ms\_commands.ROOT_DIRECTORY###

This variable will return the URL of the Mayaseed install's root directory.


###Function: ms\_commands.addShadingAttribs()###

With an object or shader selected use this function to add custom shader translation attributes to a shader.


###Function: ms\_commands.removeShadingAttribs()###

With an object or shader selected use this function to remove custom shader translation attributes to a shader


###Class: ms\_commands.MsInfoDial()###

This function shows the Mayaseed info dialogue.


###Function: ms\_commands.normalizeRGB(Tuple[Float:R,Float:G,Float:B]: Color) Returns Tuple[Float:R,Float:G,Float:B,Float:M]###

Use this function normalises a 3 value [R,G,B] tuple and returns a normalised tuple with the RGB values normalised to a 0-1 range with a 4th multiplier value.


###Function: ms\_commands.convertConnectionToImage(String:shader, String:attribute, String:dest\_file, Int:resolution=1024) Returns String:dest\_file###

This function will bake a given shading connection to an image file. 

####Argument: String:shader####

Name of the shader. e.g. "Lambert1"


####Argument: String:attribute####

The name of the attribute you want to bake. e.g. "Color"


####Argument: String:dest\_file####

The destination of the file you'd like to export


####Argument: Int:resolution####

The resolution of the image you would like to bake, images are always square.


###Function: convertTexToExr(String:file\_path, String:dest\_dir, Boolean: overwrite=True) Returns String:dest_file###

Use this function to convert an image to an .exr file using the **imf_copy** utility that ships with maya. The function returns a string containing the path to the destination file.


####Argument: String:file\_path####

File path of the image to be converted.


####Argument: String:dest\_dir####

The directory that you would like to save the converted image to. 

> Note: The converted image will have the same name as the source file but with the .exr extension.


####Argument: Boolean:overwrite = True####

By default Mayaseed will overwrite any images that have the same name as the output file, set this argument to false if you want to cancel image conversion for existing images


###Function: ms\_commands.shapeIsExportable(String:node\_name) Returns Boolean###

This function will check to see if a maya shape node is exportable based on whether it is visible and is a valid shape node.


####Argument: String:node_name####

This string is the name of the node you wish to check


####Function: ms\_commands.hasShaderConnected(String:node\_name) Returns Boolean####

This function checks whether a shape node has a shader connected.


####Argument: String:node\_name####

This string is the name of the shape node you want to check.


ms_export module
----------------

This module contains the main bulk of the code that handles the export and essentially only has one useful function.


###Function: ms_export.export(String:render_settings_node)###

This function is the workhorse of Mayaseed and does all the work in translating, exporting and writing your scene to disk based on the settings from your render settings node.


####Argument: String:String:render_settings_node####

This string is the name of the render settings node that contains the settings of your export.
